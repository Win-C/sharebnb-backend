# ShareBnB 

Sharebnb is a full stack web application for people to share and rent out their private and public spaces with others. Users create listings that include photos, location, price, # of beds, # of rooms, etc. and are able to search for created listings by price, location, # of beds, and # of bathrooms, etc. Users book listings and message other users regarding a listgin, directly on the platform.

## Motivation

As we move towards a world where people share more and more things, itâ€™s time we build an application where users can share indoor and outdoor spaces like backyards or pools!

- Key relationships:
    - Each user may have created many listings (one-to-many)
    - Each listing will only have rented to one user (*Note: this will be updated once rental dates are incorporated*)
    - Each listing may have many messages (one-to-many)
    - Each user may have sent many messages and received many messages regarding a listing (many-to-many)
